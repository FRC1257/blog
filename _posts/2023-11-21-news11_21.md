# Happy November, Snails!

Our off-season is now in full swing, so here are some updates and important information.

# Updates

The Technical Division has started doing research projects and practicing designing subsystems for previous systems. The Build department has finished their CAD and Makerspace tools training. New members have recently finished a rubber band car project to get a hang of tools, materials, and the design process. Electronics members have finished basic training and have started learning soldering and wiring. Programming members have finished Java training and are learning to do robot simulation. Returning programming members are learning to code a virtual swerve robot. Strategy has been learning Google Sheets and FRC game analysis. Documentation and safety liaisons have been picked out, and documentation has started weekly progress reports. Operations had a great run at Harvest Fest, earning over $500!
